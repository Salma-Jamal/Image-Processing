# Image Processing

1) FilteringApproaches/PeriodicNoiseRemoval: 
   - Add a periodic noise to an image.
   - Convert the noisy image to frequency domain by fourier transform.
   - Filter the image from this periodic noise using Notch filter.
   - Inverse image from fourier transform.

2) EdgeDetection/Edge_detection: 
   - Component which separates colors by an edge.
